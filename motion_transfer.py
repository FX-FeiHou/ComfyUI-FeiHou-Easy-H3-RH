"""FeiHou Easy H3 Motion Transfer: one-pass, segment-by-segment reference-video generation.

  Setup (reference mode) -> Motion Segment -> official SamplerCustomAdvanced -> Motion Collect -> Video Combine

Two ways to cut the reference video 1 (e.g. the RGB dance):

* **Shot blocks** (``shot_prompts`` connected): the markdown shot list gives
  each block its time range and its own prompt; a block is split at its
  @split points, otherwise Motion Segment decides: 帧窗口分段 cuts it into
  ``segment_frames`` clips, 不分段 samples it whole; the block is saved
  as one video.  Consecutive segments inside a block,
  and a block marked ``@continue``, are anchored to the previous segment's last
  frames through the tail guide, so the seam stays continuous; a block that
  follows a hard cut starts from nothing.  With 分段方式 上下文窗口 a long
  block with reference video is instead one segment sampled jointly with
  overlapping context windows (``h3_context_windows``), so nothing continues
  from decoded frames inside the block.
* **Fixed length** (no shot list): every ``segment_frames`` frames, as before.

Motion Segment cuts every reference video (RGB, depth, ...) and its soundtrack
to the segment's window and outputs noise / guider / sampler / sigmas / latent
for the official sampler.  Motion Collect decodes the sampled segment, adds its
frames to the block, and — until the last segment — blocks its outputs and asks
the browser to queue the next run.  After a block's last segment it outputs the
finished block, remembers its tail frame and advances the shot list; Video
Combine V2 joins the blocks into the complete film.
