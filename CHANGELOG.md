# Changelog

## v1.3.0

- Prompt optimization now sends API-only JPEG copies of reference images, capped by the node's selected `ref_image_size` and encoded at quality 85. Original H3 media is never modified.
- Reference videos now contribute compact first, middle, and last visual keyframes to compatible prompt-optimization APIs; standalone audio and video soundtracks remain local to H3 generation.
- Adds safe prompt-API diagnostics: logs include endpoint, model, API format, and media-size summaries while redacting API keys, filenames, Base64 payloads, and media contents.

## v1.2.0

- Removes filename-based filtering from the H3 Loader. Renamed community model files are now listed from their respective ComfyUI model folders.
- Lets users manually assign the selected diffusion model, text encoder, video VAE, and audio VAE to each H3 Loader role.
- Keeps `.safetensors` and `.gguf` discovery across the relevant ComfyUI model directories.

## v1.1.0

- Fixes an issue where ComfyUI serializing a Boolean as the string `"false"` could still incorrectly run the in-node prompt optimization.
- When prompt optimization is off, the node no longer makes an invalid API request or adds unnecessary waiting time.
- Improves compatibility with saved RunningHub workflows.

## v1.0.0

- Adds a visible `modified` declaration to the main node header, preserving the H3 source (`nkxx188/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Easy`).
- Embeds up to 9 images, 3 videos, and 3 standalone audio files directly in the Easy H3 node.
- Adds the FeiHou LoRA Stack input flow for the Easy H3 Loader.
- Adds ComfyUI Settings integration for API providers, configured service/model selection, and prompt-optimization rules.
- Applies the selected prompt scheme during normal node execution, and carries the final result to H3 Context / Prompt Preview.
